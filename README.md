# Sprouts
This is a recreation of a paper and pencil game called Sprouts that's built using the p5.js JavaScript library.
## How to Play
Start out by placing 2 or more dots anywhere on the page (click to place dots). The game is played turn by turn with two players.
Each turn must follow the rules below.
##### Turn Rules
1. First, a player draws a line from one dot to another or from one dot back to itself (click and hold to draw a line).
2. Lines can be curved or straight but cannot cross another line or themselves.
3. After drawing a new line, a dot must be placed somewhere on that line.
4. No dot can have more than 3 lines coming from it or going to it

The winner of Sprouts is the last person able to draw a line.
